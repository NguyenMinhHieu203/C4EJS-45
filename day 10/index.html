<p>Oliver uses nature as a springboard to the sacred-the beating heart of her work.</p>
<p style="font-size: 75%">Illustration by Deanna Halsall </p>
<p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">The Anthologist,</a>" scrawls in the margins of Oliver's â€œ<a href="https://www.24h.com.vn" target="_blank">New and Selected Poems, Volume One.</a>" A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, **They're very simple. And yet each has something." </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is what I have been doing all day. 
 </p>
 <p>The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere. 
     <br>This article appears in the print edition of the November 27, 2017, issue, with the headline "The Art of Paying Attention."
